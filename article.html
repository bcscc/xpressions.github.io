            <div class="text-article"><p class="franklin">I wonder how much privilege you must hold <br>
                To own a big house in this town <br>
                Is it a history of slaveholding? <br>
                Or is it the masters refurbished house who named himself planter instead of master to make the history books more digestible <br>
                Or was it daddy’s money? <br> Did he fund the university you attend because no child of his will ever go somewhere less than white man skin? 
                Was it trust fund baby or just white baby? <br>
                Lately, they all seem to be taking the same currency, 
                Black bodies mourning bodies <br>
                Black bodies mourning poverty<br>
                White bodies mourning….? <br>
                What does the white body mourn these days? <br>
                <br>
                While people see the beauty of this campus <br>
                I’m wondering how many of my ancestors <br>
                Built this shit by hand  If I moved a brick would I see their initials <br>
                Or just the blood spilled from generations <br>
                Of building a city they’ve never been welcomed in <br>
                </p>
                <p class="franklin text-article-right">
                  But let’s play pretend.<br>
                  That my 6 times behind grandparents were slaveholders with a plethora of white families cultivating their lands<br>
                  Where white men are nothing but  mere beast and their women bed wenches<br>
                  Have you not heard the cracka is the worst type of being.<br>
                  they are not human, rather farm animals<br>
                  breed them like dogs so we can sell their children<br>
                  Imagine if niggas was planters<br>
                  Cracking the whip on crackas backs and seasoning it with salt cause white bloody pain makes the big man get<br>
                  off.<br>
                  Skin their porcelain white skin for our furniture set,<br>
                  Bathe in their blood to keep the wrinkles off.<br>
                  Are the white people getting angry?<br>
                  Cause I got about 401 years of history that I can fucking talk about<br>
                  when black people talk about their pain you yearn to insert yourself in the conversation<br>
                  So let's play with the roles<br>
                  Let’s pretend its you trying to get your seat at this table<br>
                  While we push you out with lynching, laws, dogs, fires, bullets from men in these repurposed cloaks<br>
                  Think about being scared to call 911<br>
                  Think about how itchy the rope  around your neck is as a crowd is cheering and laughing<br>
                  Eating popcorn while all you can say is<br>
                  “please let me go, I got babies at home”<br>
                  Before they let your body fly like a fucking flag<br>
                  In a cold air<br>
                  Imagine knowing its not your time to die yet<br>
                  Imagine you find your sons body floating in the ravine<br>
                  Imagine your daughter comes home with tattered clothes and knowing you can’t do anything because it was<br>
                  the white boys whose father<br>
                  Is known for wearing the cloak<br>
                  Imagine<br>
                  Imagine<br>
                  Imagine<br>
                  Being comfortable in a classroom where everyone looks like you<br>
                  Where you are taught about you is beyond the realm of chains and shackles<br>
                  Ugh… excuse me<br>
                  As I force myself to make space for the lack of white voices in this poem<br>
                  Because I know they are gonna complain about shit that happened 401 years ago.<br>
                  Imagine niggas saying that to you with a straight fucking face<br>
                  Unprovoked and sitting on their daddys money.<br>
                  Imagine the crackas rioting, imagine white lives mattering,<br>
                  imagine crackas fixing they mouth to call niggas the oppressor.<br>
                  <br>
                  </p>
                  <p class="franklin">I bet you're relieved this was just a poem.<br>
                    no one expected that the negro’s<br>
                    Who plotted the soil and built the town,<br>
                    would get this far.<br>
                    I bet its a relief, that while my family were disregarded by historians<br>
                    Yours was uplifted, applauded for their thievery.<br>
                    As I sit here  on this bus<br>
                    Looking at these big houses<br>
                    that hold so much privilege in their standing.</p>
